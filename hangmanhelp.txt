Hangman Help:

Hangman v. 5.1.2

Game Rules:
Hangman is a word guessing game. 
The object of the game is to guess the word in a certain number of guesses.
There are no capital letters or punctuation marks. Proper nouns are written in all lowercase, and there are no contractions or abbreviations. 
You guess by typing in a letter after the line saying:
	Please guess a letter
If you know the word, and wish to guess it, type in "word".
This will give you one chance to type in the word. 
If you guess it correctly, you win. If you do not type it in correctly, you lose.

Game modes:
Beginner mode gives you twenty incorrect guesses before you lose.
Easy mode gives you ten incorrect guesses before you lose.
Medium mode gives you seven incorrect guesses.
Hard mode gives you five incorrect guesses.
