Chess help:
Chess is a game about capturing your opponent's king.
Each piece may move in distinct ways.
The first letter of each piece determines its type, the second its color.
The pieces move as follows:
Pawn:       Knight:     Bishop:     Rook:       Queen:      King:
 - - - - -   - • - • -   \ - - - /   - - ^ - -   \ - ^ - /   - - - - -
 - * + * -   • - - - •   - \ - / -   - - | - -   - \ | / -   - • • • -
 - - p - -   - - n - -   - - b - -   ‹—— r ——›   ‹—— q ——›   - • k • -
 - - - - -   • - - - •   - / - \ -   - - | - -   - / | \ -   - • • • -
 - - - - -   - • - • -   / - - - \   - - ˇ - -   / - ˇ - \   - - - - -

Key:
 •  Move to that space
 +  Move to that space, but only if it is unoccupied
 *  Move to that space, but only if there is an opposing piece there
 \/ Move as many spaces diagonally as desired
 ‹——Move as many spaces orthoganally as desired
No piece may capture another piece of its color
Only the knight may "jump" over other pieces, no others may pass
    through another of either color on its path

Check and checkmate:
    If the king is in danger of being captured, 'Check' will be shown
    If 'check' is shown, the other player must remove the king from check
        on their next turn, or they will lose
    If the king is in check, and it is impossible for the other player to
        get out of check, 'Checkmate' will be shown
    Checkmate is the end of the game

Special pawn moves:
    Pawns may move up to two spaces forwards on their first move
    Pawns may not capture directly forwards; if there is an enemy piece
        in front of them, they may not move
    Pawns may move diagonally only to capture, not if the space is empty
        or friendly-occupied
    If a pawn reaches the end of the board, it must change into another
        piece of the player's desire (except king)
